# California Housing Price Prediction using Linear Regression

This project is an end-to-end **Linear Regression** implementation built using
**Azure Machine Learning Designer** to predict housing prices in California.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to predict the **median house value** for California
districts based on demographic and geographic features.

---

## 📊 Dataset
- **Source:** California Housing Dataset (Kaggle)
- **Type:** Tabular data

### Features
- longitude  
- latitude  
- housing_median_age  
- total_rooms  
- total_bedrooms  
- population  
- households  
- median_income  

### Target Variable
- **median_house_value**

---

## 🧠 Model & Approach
- Algorithm: **Linear Regression**
- Platform: **Azure Machine Learning Designer**
- Data preprocessing:
  - Removed missing values
  - Split data into training and test sets (80/20)

---

## 📈 Results
- **R² Score:** **0.81**

The model demonstrates strong predictive performance, explaining approximately
81% of the variance in housing prices.
